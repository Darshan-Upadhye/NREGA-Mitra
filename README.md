# NREGA ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ (NREGA Mitra)

### *Discover the Progress Happening Near You.*

## üß≠ Overview

**NREGA ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞** is a citizen-centric web application built to simplify and visualize the performance data of the **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)**.  
The goal is to help citizens, especially in rural areas, understand how their **district** is performing in terms of employment generation, project completion, and welfare impact.

While the **Government of India** provides open access to this data through an API, the raw format is often difficult for non-technical users to interpret.  
**NREGA ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞** bridges this gap by converting complex government data into **clear, visual insights** that anyone can explore.

## üß© Problem Statement

> ‚ÄúOur Voice, Our Rights‚Äù ‚Äî The data is public, but not always accessible.

The [MGNREGA Open Data API](https://data.gov.in/catalog/mahatma-gandhi-national-rural-employment-guarantee-act-mgnrega) offers monthly performance metrics for each district across India.  
However, challenges persist:

- The information is **too technical** for the average citizen to interpret.  
- The **API can be rate-limited** or go offline, making direct usage unreliable.  
- **Digital literacy levels** in many rural areas remain low, creating a gap between open data and actual awareness.

**NREGA ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞** empowers citizens to see, compare, and understand their district‚Äôs MGNREGA performance ‚Äî in a simple, human-friendly way.

## üéØ Project Goal

To design and build a **production-ready, scalable, and inclusive platform** that provides easy-to-understand insights into district-level MGNREGA data.  
It focuses on **clarity, accessibility, and reliability**, ensuring that information remains available even when the government API is down.

## üß± System Architecture

1. **Backend (Express.js + MongoDB)**  
   - Fetches live data from the [data.gov.in MGNREGA API](https://data.gov.in/catalog/mahatma-gandhi-national-rural-employment-guarantee-act-mgnrega).  
   - Stores and updates the data in MongoDB for offline access and better performance.  
   - Uses `node-cron` to schedule automatic background updates.

2. **Frontend (Next.js)**  
   - Displays district and state-level insights through interactive charts and cards.  
   - Implements responsive, mobile-friendly design for accessibility.  
   - Server-side rendering ensures better SEO and faster initial load times.

3. **Hosting & Deployment**  
   - Backend and database deployed on a **VPS/VM** for stability and scalability.  
   - Frontend deployed with build optimization for production.
