## üß≠ Overview

**NREGA ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞** is a citizen-centric web application designed to make the performance data of the **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)** simple and accessible to all.  
The platform helps people, especially in rural India, explore how their **district** is performing in generating employment, completing works, and utilizing funds under the MGNREGA scheme.

The data provided by the **Government of India** through [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/catalog/mahatma-gandhi-national-rural-employment-guarantee-act-mgnrega) is open but not always easy to understand.  
**NREGA ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞** transforms this complex dataset into **visual insights** that every citizen can explore effortlessly.

## üß© Problem Statement

> ‚ÄúOur Voice, Our Rights‚Äù ‚Äî The data is public, but not always accessible.

The Government of India provides an open API containing district-wise monthly performance data for MGNREGA.  
However, several issues limit its usefulness to the public:

- The data format is **too technical** for non-technical citizens.  
- The API may face **downtime or rate limits**, making direct access unreliable.  
- **Data literacy is low** in rural areas, leaving people disconnected from insights that affect their lives.

**NREGA ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞** bridges this gap by providing an intuitive platform where citizens can **see, compare, and understand** their district‚Äôs MGNREGA performance in plain, visual terms.

---

## üéØ Project Goal

To create a **scalable, production-ready, and inclusive platform** that brings MGNREGA data to life for rural citizens.  
The platform focuses on **clarity, accessibility, and resilience**, ensuring data remains available even when external APIs are not.
